Subject: [PATCH 5/8] gst145-v4l2bufferpool: Change the buffer number to be 
 queued into V4L2

Porting from a patch in Linux 3.10 environment made by Kazunori Kobayashi <kkobayas@igel.co.jp>

Apparently the continuous frame capturing mode of VIN has to
have at least 3 buffers to be queued into the driver in order to
output frames and the GStreamer pipeline occupies up to 2 buffers
, which correspond to the front and back buffers in the videosink.
The total number to circulate the V4L2 buffers in the pipeline is 5,
so this patch sets that as the buffer pool parameter.

Also this change suppresses the buffer copying that occurs when
running out of the remaining buffers in the queue.

v4l2bufferpool: Set the minimum number of the buffers as the same
with the maximum number

This patch pre-allocates the buffers as many as the maximum number
when the buffer pool is activated because the maximum number which
has already been set is essential for the contiguous capturing mode
and it would be efficient that all of the buffers are allocated
at the initialization of this plugin.
